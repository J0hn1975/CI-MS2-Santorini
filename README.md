## Structure
The website has been structured with 4 web pages. Each page is cleary designed, easy to navigate, and with well layed out information. With a mobile first approach in mind I have used bootstrap throughout to make the site respoinsive on mobile devices.

> The 4 pages are:
> 1. Home Page: A welcome message, brief description of the island greet the user, as well as a map of where the island is located and the current weather forecast
> 2. Quiz Page: A 10 question quiz on Santorini, with progess indicators for each question, right and wrong answers are higlighted, with a table at the end showing overall progress
> 3. Contact Page: A contact page to allow the user to contact the site owner, warnings if the incorrect information has been entered and alert then the form is submitted.
> 4. 404: This alerts users if they have entered an incorrect URL for the site. The user is presented with warning message, navbar and footer.

## Skeleton
To design and develop the wireframes I first used Balsamiq, then used Snipping Tools to create PNG versions. The wireframes images are designed to collaspe.

## Surface
## Colours
Each page is design with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:
> - #FFCC51 - used as a background color for the footer and navbar
> - #050505 - used for the site brand and nav links
> - #009688 - used to style the quiz text.

For the most part of I have used the Titilium Web Google font, with a fallback of Sans Serif should Titilium Web not work.
